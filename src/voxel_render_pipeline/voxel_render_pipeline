    // used to render voxel-based graphics in a 3D environment.
    // It includes shaders for rendering voxels, handling lighting, and applying post-processing effects.
    
    // The pipeline consists of the following stages:
    // 1. Vertex Shader: Processes vertex data and transforms it into clip space.
    // 2. Fragment Shader: Computes the color of each pixel based on lighting and texture.
    // 3. Post-Processing: Applies effects such as bloom, depth of field, etc.

        // 1. Bind the vertex shader
        // 2. Set up the vertex buffer with voxel data
        // 3. Bind the fragment shader
        // 4. Issue draw calls to render the voxels
